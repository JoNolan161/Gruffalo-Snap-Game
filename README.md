Hello! I am an aspiring Junior Front-End Developer passionate about levelling up my skills for a career move. 

Here are some of the things I've been working on lately:

 - Gruffalo 'Snap' Game - a simple two player card matching game designed for kids. 
 
 - Mortgage Calculator - a calculator accepting 3 inputs; mortgage amount, term and interest rate to compute a monthly repayment.

 - Todo List - a classic beginner's project to add and remove list items.

 - Tip Calculator - another beginner's classic accepting 2 arguments; bill amount and tip percentage to compute a final bill.
